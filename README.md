# Smart Guitar IoT Device Website

This project is a fully functional website developed to market and sell an innovative IoT deviceâ€”a **Smart Guitar**. The website was created as part of a university assignment a few years ago, with the primary goal of showcasing a conceptual IoT product and simulating an e-commerce experience.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to design and develop a website to promote and sell a fictional IoT device that our team conceptualized. By the end of the semester, the website served as a platform to present our product and demonstrate our understanding of web development principles. 

The featured product, the **Smart Guitar**, is an IoT-enabled guitar with advanced features designed to enhance the playing experience. While the main focus of the assignment was to gain hands-on experience in website development, the project also allowed us to explore creative product design and marketing strategies.

## Code Structure

- **`JSTech.html`**: This file contains the majority of the code, compiled from IA1 to IA89, and serves as the core of the website.
- **Folders**: The project is organized into multiple folders, each containing different sections of the website's code. This modular structure makes it easier to navigate and understand the various components of the project.

## Key Features

- **Product Showcase**: Highlights the unique features of the Smart Guitar.
- **E-commerce Simulation**: Includes product details, pricing, and a mock checkout process.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the website is accessible and functional across different devices.

This project was a valuable learning experience in web development, product conceptualization, and teamwork. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own projects!
